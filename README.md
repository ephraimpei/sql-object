# SQL Object

## Summary

SQL Object is an ORM solution that maps SQL queries onto Ruby objects. It aims
to provide an alternative to ActiveRecord.

## Libraries

- SQLite3
- RSpec
- ActiveSupport::Inflector

## Features

- Replicates core functionality of ActiveRecord::Base

## API

SQLObject provides a few of your favorite ActiveRecord associations:

- `has_many`
- `belongs_to`
- `has_one_through`

SQLObject provides the following ActiveRecord methods:

- `#save`
- `#create`
- `#update`
- `#destroy`

## How It Works

SQLObject makes reference to [`DBConnection`](/lib/db_connection.rb), which delegates SQLite::Database
instance methods like `#execute`, `#get_first_row`, `#last_insert_row_id`, etc.
to a singleton instance of SQLite::Database. Consumers of the API specify this
instance by calling `DBConnection::open(file)`, providing an SQLite db file path
as an argument.

SQLObject provides a utility belt of class/instance methods that map to SQL queries.

Associations (`has_many`, `belongs_to`, `has_one_through`) are dynamically
generated by the [`Associatable`](./lib/associatable.rb) module, which extends
SQLObject. Associations infer `class_name`, `foreign_key` and `primary_key`
based on the same conventions as ActiveRecord. You can override these if the
database schema you're working with is non-compliant (or ActiveSupport::Inflector fails to guess your table name).
